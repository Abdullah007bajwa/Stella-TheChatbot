# Stella Chatbot

Stella Chatbot is your friendly, AI-powered companion, designed to assist in daily conversations and tasks. Built on a robust Django framework, Stella combines AIML, machine learning, web scraping, and Prolog to offer an intuitive and engaging chat experience. Whether you need a friend to chat with, information at your fingertips, or help with tasks, Stella is here to make your day easier and more enjoyable.

## üåü Key Features

### üö™ **User Authentication:**
- **Sign-In:** Quick and secure login for registered users, with validations to ensure the correct email and password.
- **Sign-Up:** Seamlessly create a new account, complete with Neo4j integration for user nodes and robust validations for email and password matching.
- **Profile Picture:** Customize your profile with an uploaded image or choose a default based on gender.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Access with Decorators:**
- Protects chat access by ensuring users are logged in. If authenticated, users are directed straight to the chat; otherwise, they're prompted to sign in.

### üí¨ **Interactive Chat Screen:**
- A sleek chat interface allows users to converse with Stella while viewing their profile details, making the experience personal and engaging.

### üß† **AIML-Powered Conversations:**
- Leverages AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) for basic chat functionalities, powered by PyAIML21. AIML files are centrally stored and easily managed.

### üéØ **Smart GET/SET Predicates:**
- Determines the best response source (AIML, Wikipedia, or Prolog knowledge base) based on user queries, making interactions more relevant.

### ‚ú® **Advanced Spell Checker:**
- Utilizes "Spello," a custom-trained spell checker, ensuring accurate responses tailored to Stella's specific knowledge base.

### üåê **Web Scraping with Wikipedia Integration:**
- Retrieves and stores rich information (like personal and organizational details) from Wikipedia, optimizing future interactions by saving data in Neo4j.

### üîç **Prolog Knowledge Base:**
- Implements a robust Prolog system using Pytholog, allowing Stella to infer new knowledge from user-provided facts and relationships. This knowledge is preserved in a pickle file and integrated into Neo4j.

### ü§ñ **Machine Learning Models:**
- Employs cutting-edge models (Logistic Regression, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, SVM SVC, RNN, DNN) for predictive tasks like gender inference during Prolog relationship creation. These models ensure Stella evolves with each interaction, thanks to efficient learning and inference.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pmchohan/stella.git
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Neo4j:**
   - Set up your Neo4j database and adjust the connection settings in your Django configuration.

6. **Apply Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Modify Paths for AIML and Spell Checker:**
   - To make the chatbot fully active, update the paths in the code where AIML files and spell training data are referenced. For example:

   ```python
   from pyaiml21 import Kernel
   from glob import glob
   from spello.model import SpellCorrectionModel
   from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
   from nltk.corpus import wordnet
   from .scrapping import scrap
   from .prolog import check_predicates

   myBot = Kernel()
   corrector = SpellCorrectionModel(language="en")

   def initialization(username, u_id):
       u_id = str(u_id)
       global myBot
       myBot = Kernel()
       aimls = glob(r"C:\Users\YourUsername\YourProjectPath\chatbot\stella\chatbot\aiml_files\*")
       for aiml in aimls:
           print(aiml)
           myBot.learn(aiml)
       myBot.respond('remove what predicate', u_id)
       myBot.setPredicate('username', username, sessionID=u_id)
       myBot.respond('reset questions', u_id)
       myBot.respond('reset facts', u_id)
       spell_checker()

   def spell_checker():
       global corrector
       corrector = SpellCorrectionModel(language="en")
       with open(r'C:\Users\YourUsername\YourProjectPath\chatbot\stella\chatbot\spell_training_data.txt', 'r') as file:
           data = file.readlines()

       data = [i.strip() for i in data]
       corrector.train(data)
   ```

   - Replace `C:\Users\YourUsername\YourProjectPath` with the appropriate path on your machine.

8. **Launch the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
